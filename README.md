# ðŸ“– Overview
This project is a Parallax Scrolling Website built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The website uses a smooth scrolling effect, where background images move at different speeds to create a stunning parallax effect, providing a visually immersive experience.

# ðŸš€ Features
- Parallax Scrolling: Dynamic background movement based on the scroll position.
- Smooth scrolling and transitions for a fluid user experience.
- Responsive design, ensuring compatibility across different devices and screen sizes.
- Clean and modern UI with layered effects.

# ðŸ’» Technologies Used
- HTML5: For structuring the content.
- CSS3: For styling, layout, and implementing the parallax effect.
- JavaScript (ES6): For enhancing interactivity, smooth scrolling, and additional dynamic effects.

# ðŸ›  How It Works
- Parallax Effect: As the user scrolls, background images move at different speeds relative to the foreground, creating a depth illusion.
- Responsive Design: CSS media queries ensure the parallax effect adapts smoothly across mobile, tablet, and desktop devices.
- JavaScript Enhancements: Smooth scrolling and additional effects are powered by JavaScript for a more engaging experience.

# ðŸ›  Future Enhancements
- Add more interactive elements such as animations or hover effects.
- Optimize performance for even smoother scrolling on low-power devices.
- Implement additional sections with advanced parallax features (e.g., layered animations).
