                    <h2>Trees - Lungs of earthüåç</h2>
                    <p>We live in an ecosystem with other living beings. One of the most pillars of an ecosystem 
                    is the trees. The green living beings provide us with the oxygen we need to breathe and live. 
                    Trees process carbon dioxide and use sunlight to make their food. In this process, they release 
                    oxygen that every other animal needs to live. Trees provide more benefits and make our planet 
                    sustainable. Despite such benefits of trees, we are deforesting the green reserves for our 
                    profits and slowly killing the planet.
                    Trees are the big plants that have a green hood of foliage. A tree provides us with shades in 
                    the hot days. The cool shade relieves us from scorching heat so that we can rest. We find them
                    in the big parks and roadsides of well-planned cities. We find many trees in rural areas. This 
                    is why the air we breathe in the villages is very clean. Trees have the innate properties to 
                    clean air by absorbing carbon dioxide during the daytime. They have the biological power to 
                    convert carbon dioxide into carbohydrates using the power of sunlight. This is what we depend 
                    on. The entire ecosystem depends on what plants produce. An ecosystem depends on these producers
                    of the food chain. These producers support the life of herbivores and the rest of the animals 
                    in the chain. <br><br>
